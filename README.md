# Crystals Collector Game!

* Four crystals are displayed on the page.

* A random number is shown at the start of the game.

* When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score, which is displayed below.

* The player **wins** if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.

* The player **loses** if their score goes above the random number.

* Whenever the player wins or loses, the game restarts with a new random number and wins and losses are shown. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values.
